    "#### Artificial intelligence \n",
    "It refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks like reasoning, decision-making, and problem-solving. It focuses on creating intelligent systems that can mimic human behavior. AI can be rule-based, knowledge-driven, or data-driven, and it includes subfields like robotics, natural language processing (NLP), and computer vision.\n",

    "#### Machine learning \n",
    "It is a subset of AI that uses algorithms to enable systems to learn from data and improve over time without explicit programming. It focuses on identifying patterns and making predictions or decisions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deep learning \n",
    "It is a specialized subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to process and analyze data. It excels at handling large datasets and complex, unstructured data like images, audio, and text. DL models automatically extract features from raw data, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering."

    "\n",
    "### 🧩 What is Batch (Offline) Learning?\n",
    "- In **Batch Learning**, the model is trained on the **entire dataset at once**.\n",
    "- Once trained, the model remains **static** until it is retrained from scratch on new data.\n",
    "- Commonly used for **stable, large datasets** where data doesn’t change rapidly.\n",

    "Machine learning approach where the system memorizes training examples and uses them to classify new instances based on a similarity measure. It is also referred to as lazy learning because it delays computation until a new query needs to be classified. Instead of building a global model, it relies on local approximations derived from the stored instances.\n",
