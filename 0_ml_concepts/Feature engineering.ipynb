    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What is Feature Engineering?\n",
    "**Feature Engineering** is the process of using domain knowledge to **extract, transform, and select meaningful features** from raw data to improve the performance of machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It bridges the gap between **raw data** and **predictive insight** — shaping data into forms that models can learn from effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Key Components of Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature Transformation\n",
    "Transforming existing features to make them more suitable for algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Normalization / Scaling:** Bring all numerical columns to the same range  \n",
    "  _(e.g., Min-Max Scaling, Standardization (Z-score))_\n",
    "- **Log Transform / Box-Cox:** Reduce skewness in data.\n",
    "- **Binning / Discretization:** Convert continuous values into categorical bins.\n",
    "- **Encoding Categorical Features:**  \n",
    "  - One-Hot Encoding  \n",
    "  - Label Encoding  \n",
    "  - Target / Frequency Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Feature Construction\n",
    "Creating **new features** from existing ones to better represent the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Polynomial features  \n",
    "- Ratios, differences, or interaction terms between variables  \n",
    "- Date-time features (year, month, day, weekday, time delta, etc.)  \n",
    "- Domain-specific logic (e.g., conversion rates, ratios, flags)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Feature Selection\n",
    "Reducing dimensionality by keeping only **relevant features** and removing noisy or redundant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter Methods:** Correlation, Chi-square test, ANOVA  \n",
    "- **Wrapper Methods:** Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)  \n",
    "- **Embedded Methods:** Lasso (L1), Ridge (L2), Decision Tree feature importance  \n",
    "- Benefits: Improves performance, reduces overfitting, and speeds up training.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Feature Extraction\n",
    "Deriving new compact representations from existing data (usually high-dimensional).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)** – reduces correlated features into uncorrelated components.  \n",
    "- **t-SNE / UMAP** – for visualization and non-linear dimensionality reduction.  \n",
    "- **Autoencoders** – deep learning approach to learn compressed feature representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Handling Common Data Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧩 Missing Value Imputation\n",
    "- Replace missing values with **Mean, Median, or Mode** (depending on data type).  \n",
    "- Use special placeholders like `\"Unknown\"` or `0` when appropriate.  \n",
    "- Advanced: **KNN imputation**, **Iterative Imputer**, or **model-based imputation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🎭 Handling Categorical Features\n",
    "- One-Hot Encoding (for nominal data)  \n",
    "- Ordinal Encoding (for ordered categories)  \n",
    "- Frequency Encoding (for high-cardinality features)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚨 Outlier Detection\n",
    "Outliers can heavily affect model performance.\n",
    "- Techniques:\n",
    "  - Z-score, IQR method, Isolation Forest, or DBSCAN  \n",
    "- Decision point:\n",
    "  - **Keep** outliers if they represent real, meaningful variations.  \n",
    "  - **Remove** them if they result from data errors or noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📏 Feature Scaling\n",
    "Ensures all numeric features contribute equally during model training.\n",
    "- **Standardization:** \\( x' = \\frac{x - \\mu}{\\sigma} \\)\n",
    "- **Normalization:** \\( x' = \\frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}} \\)\n",
    "- **Robust Scaling:** Scales using median and IQR (useful with outliers).\n",
    "\n",
